Hi, I’m **Afiq (nyamuk14)**, currently studying at :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

Right now I’m really interested in **DFIR** (digital forensics and incident response), but I’m still in the slow learning phase. I’m not rushing, I’m just trying to get the fundamentals right and improve little by little.

I did my internship at :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} and got some real exposure to how work feels in an actual environment, not just theory.

## what i like to do
- 🎣 Fishing when I need peace
- 🎮 Playing :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- 🧩 Doing CTFs when I have extra time (sometimes I disappear for hours if the challenge is nice)

## certs
I do some free certs whenever I can because I don’t really have money to go for the expensive ones yet, huhu sad. But I’m still collecting what I can and building skills from practice.
